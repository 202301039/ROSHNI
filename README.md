## ðŸ“– Project Documentation

All project planning, requirements, design decisions, and architectural diagrams are stored within the `/docs` directory. This serves as the single source of truth for the "what" and "why" behind our work.

You can access the main documentation hub here: **[./docs/](./docs/)**

The documentation is organized into the following key areas:

| Directory                                                           | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[01_requirements_elicitation/](./docs/01_requirements_elicitation/)** | Contains all artifacts from the initial requirement gathering phase, including stakeholder analysis, interview notes, workshop outputs, and user personas. |
| **[02_agile_planning/](./docs/02_agile_planning/)** | Home to our Agile process documents. Here you will find our high-level EPICs and the concept posters for each sprint.                      |
| **[03_architecture/](./docs/03_architecture/)** | Includes system architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), and decisions regarding our technical design.                          |

> **Note:** The living Product Backlog, User Stories, and Sprint Boards will be managed directly in our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/202301039/ROSHNI/issues)** and **[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/202301039/ROSHNI/projects)** tabs for real-time tracking.
