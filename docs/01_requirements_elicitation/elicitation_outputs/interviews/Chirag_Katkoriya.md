### **Interview Notes: Chirag Katkoriya (202301259)**

### **Overall Summary**

The interview with Chirag provided some valuable feedback on our concept. He emphasized on three key points, the app needs to be reliable, needs to use limited number of resources, and should handle private information carefully (data privacy is important). He's open to sharing necessary details like his home address and phone number for accurate alerts, but made it clear that data privacy is a major concern.

During a disaster, he is less concerned about the type of event, and rather, want to get information about what to do, the steps that should be taken, etc. For high-priority alerts, he suggested introducing a voice call feature to alert users. He also said that a simple SOS button, with an option for a quick voice message is preferred for reporting a disaster. He said that the idea of implementing a map was important, and should include features like locations for shelters, road closures, and tracking famility members. He also mentioned that the app needs to be lightweight, without being a major user of battery life and other resources.

### **Detailed Q&A**

**1. When you first set up the app, what personal information would you be comfortable sharing to ensure you receive the most accurate and relevant emergency alerts?**"I'd be okay with sharing my Home Address, Name, Phone Number, and my Email ID."

**2. In the first notification you receive about a potential disaster, what is the single most critical piece of information you would need to see immediately?**
"For me, it would be the steps that you need to take first. That's more important than the type of disaster, etc."

**3. How would you prefer to be notified of a high-priority alert to ensure it grabs your attention?**
"An automated phone call. That would definitely get my attention."

**4. If you were witnessing an emergency, what would be the quickest and easiest way for you to report it through the app?**
"An SOS button is better, and then maybe the ability to record a voice message."

**5. During a Disaster: Would you be willing to provide real-time updates? What would make you feel safe doing so?**
"Yeah, but instead of me having to type out the situation, I'd prefer to take a quick questionnaire if that's possible. It would feel safer."

**6. Trust in Information: The app will summarize information from various sources. What are your biggest concerns about this?**
"Fake news, or something like that. You really need to have verified sources for everything."

**7. Interactive Map: When looking at the live disaster map, what features would be most useful to you and your family?**
"Let's see... Emergency Shelters, Medical Aid Stations, Road Closures, and Safe Zones for sure. Also showing where family members and responders are would be great."

**8. Resource Tracking: How helpful would it be to see the real-time location of dispatched emergency services on the map?**
"It would be good to have that information also. If not real-time, then an ETA is fine."

**9. Aftermath and Recovery: Once a disaster has passed, what kind of information would you find most helpful?**
"I'd want updates on injuries and the recovery efforts, any information on financial aid, a summary of what happened, and tips for future preparedness."

**10. Overall Concerns & Wishlist: Aside from what we've discussed, what's your biggest concern? Is there any essential feature we missed?**
"Data privacy is really important. Moreover, the app should be reliable and should be minimal, you know, not consume very much battery. I can't think of any other essentail features you guys missed."
