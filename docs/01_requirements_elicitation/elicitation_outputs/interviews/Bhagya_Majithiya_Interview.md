# Interview with Bhagya Majithiya (202301269)

## Summary
The interview with Bhagya Majithiya provided thoughtful insights into our disaster management app, focusing on practicality, reliability, and user-friendly features during crises. He's open to sharing basic personal info like name, location, phone number, and email for setup, and even ID proof if it's a government-regulated app, showing a willingness to comply for better service. However, he stressed balancing data privacy, especially outside of disasters, and minimizing battery consumption overall.

For alerts, he prefers initial notifications that highlight nearby shelters, responder contacts, and do's/don'ts over excessive details on the disaster type. He suggested a loud, government-style SMS alert that requires dismissal after reading to ensure attention. Reporting emergencies should be quick with an SOS button, voice input, and photos, while real-time updates might be limited due to bandwidth issues—he'd prefer calls or short voice notes, or at most a 3-4 question survey. To build trust, prioritize government sources over social media to combat fake news. On maps, show shelters, emergency camps, and danger zones without cluttering with routes or excessive details like service ETAs. Post-disaster, he'd value info on casualties, losses, damaged areas, and lost-and-found reports. Bhagya emphasized making the app efficient on resources, noting that privacy matters less in emergencies but should be handled carefully otherwise.

## Key Points to Consider
- **Personal Data and Privacy:** Comfortable with name, location, phone, email, and ID proof for government apps; prioritize proper handling of location data outside disasters to maintain privacy.
- **Alert Prioritization:** Focus on shelters, responder contacts, and do's/don'ts in initial alerts; use a loud, dismissible SMS-style notification for high-priority alerts.
- **Reporting Simplicity:** Implement an SOS button with voice and photo options; for updates, prefer calls/voice notes or very short surveys (3-4 questions) to account for low bandwidth.
- **Information Trust:** Combat fake news by prioritizing government sources and downplaying social media.
- **Map Features:** Highlight nearby shelters, camps, and danger zones; avoid clutter, routes, or real-time service tracking to prevent confusion.
- **Post-Disaster Support:** Include updates on casualties, losses, damaged areas, and lost-and-found reports.
- **App Efficiency:** Minimize battery consumption; relax privacy slightly during disasters but enforce it strictly at other times.

## Interview Transcript

**I. Setup and Alerts**

1. **Getting Started:** When you first set up the app, what personal information (e.g., home address, work address, current location tracking) would you be comfortable sharing to ensure you receive the most accurate and relevant emergency alerts?  
   *Response:* Name, Location, Phone. No., Email, If government app, then ID proof also if required/regulated by government.

2. **Alert Content:** In the first notification you receive about a potential disaster, what is the single most critical piece of information you would need to see immediately? (For example: the type of disaster, immediate safety instructions, evacuation routes, or contact information for help).  
   *Response:* Nearby Shelter Location, Contacts of Responders and Steps (Type of disaster is okay, but detailed information is unecessary and can be informed later). Dos and Donts are better.

3. **Notification Method:** How would you prefer to be notified of a high-priority alert to ensure it grabs your attention? (e.g., a persistent, loud alarm from the app, a simultaneous text message, or an automated phone call).  
   *Response:* Loud SMS or government type alert on the phone screen that needs dismissal after reading.

**II. Reporting and Information Sharing**

4. **Reporting an Emergency:** If you were witnessing an emergency, what would be the quickest and easiest way for you to report it through the app? (e.g., a single "SOS" button that sends your location, the ability to upload a photo/video, a quick voice message, or a simple text form).  
   *Response:* Voice + Photos, and SOS button

5. **During a Disaster:** Would you be willing to provide real-time updates on your immediate surroundings (e.g., "road is blocked," "power is out") to help response teams and other users? What would make you feel safe doing so?  
   *Response:* High chance is no. Maybe on a call it’s better, or a voice note. If not enough bandwidth available, then a very short survey 3-4 questions is okay.

6. **Trust in Information:** The app will summarize information from official news, social media, and other user reports. What are your biggest concerns about the accuracy of this information, and what would help you trust the updates you receive?  
   *Response:* Fake news concern, give more priority to government websites, and then social media lesser priority.

**III. Maps and UI**

7. **Interactive Map:** When looking at the live disaster map, what features would be most useful to you and your family? (e.g., locations of emergency shelters, medical aid stations, road closures, safe zones, or family members who also use the app).  
   *Response:* Nearby Shelters and emergency camps, etc. and also show which area is dangerous, should be avoided.

8. **Resource Tracking:** How helpful would it be to see the real-time location of dispatched emergency services (like ambulances or fire trucks) on the map during an incident?  
   *Response:* Could be helpful, but clutter and confusion should be avoided. Route should not be shown.

**IV. Post-Disaster and Overall Feedback**

9. **Aftermath and Recovery:** Once a disaster has passed, what kind of information would you find most helpful to receive through the app? (e.g., updates on recovery efforts, information on financial aid, or tips for future preparedness).  
   *Response:* Casualties and Losses, and also lost and found reports as well. Areas that are damaged.

10. **Overall Concerns & Wishlist:** Aside from the features discussed, what is your biggest concern about using an application like this for your safety (e.g., data privacy, battery consumption)? Is there any one feature you believe is essential that we haven't mentioned?  
    *Response:* Battery Consuption is important. Data privacy is not as important during disaster, but non-disaster time, proper handling of location etc. is very important.
