# Interview with Manit Shah (202301425)

## Summary
The interview with Manit offered insightful feedback on our disaster management app. He highlighted the importance of user trust, minimal intrusion, and practical features that prioritize safety without overwhelming the user. He's comfortable sharing essential personal details like name, phone number, email, address, close contacts, and location to get alerts, but raised questions about the app's runtime behavior, such as whether it runs 24/7 or only activates during disasters, and if it constantly tracks location—indicating concerns around privacy and resource usage.

For alerts, he stressed the need for immediate info on the disaster type and its personal impact, along with a highly attention-grabbing notification like a loud, persistent SOS alarm that can only be turned off via the power button. When reporting emergencies, he favored a simple button leading to photo or video upload, and for real-time updates, he'd share info if it involved minimal questions to keep it quick and safe. He emphasized including sources with all information to build trust and enable informed decisions. On the map, he'd value seeing the disaster area, responder locations, and ETA for services (but not routes). Post-disaster, he wants updates on affected civilians' status and next-step guidelines. Overall, Manit seems focused on making the app efficient, reliable, and non-intrusive.

## Key Points to Consider
- **Personal Data and Privacy:** Allow users to share key info (name, phone, email, address, contacts, location) but address concerns about constant app runtime and location tracking—perhaps with options for on-demand activation.
- **Alert Prioritization:** Focus on disaster type and user impact in initial notifications; implement a persistent, loud alarm for high-priority alerts.
- **Reporting Simplicity:** Use a one-tap SOS button with easy photo/video upload; minimize questions for real-time sharing to encourage participation.
- **Information Trust:** Always display sources alongside updates to help users verify accuracy.
- **Map Features:** Include disaster areas, responder locations, and ETA for services; family tracking and resource locations are implied as useful.
- **Post-Disaster Support:** Provide status updates on victims and clear recovery guidelines.
- **App Efficiency:** Ensure low battery/resource use; clarify if the app is always-on or event-triggered.

## Interview Transcript

**I. Setup and Alerts**

1. **Getting Started:** When you first set up the app, what personal information (e.g., home address, work address, current location tracking) would you be comfortable sharing to ensure you receive the most accurate and relevant emergency alerts?  
   *Response:* Name, Phone No., Email ID, Address, Close Contacts, Location

2. **Alert Content:** In the first notification you receive about a potential disaster, what is the single most critical piece of information you would need to see immediately? (For example: the type of disaster, immediate safety instructions, evacuation routes, or contact information for help).  
   *Response:* What type of disaster, and how much will it affect the user.

3. **Notification Method:** How would you prefer to be notified of a high-priority alert to ensure it grabs your attention? (e.g., a persistent, loud alarm from the app, a simultaneous text message, or an automated phone call).  
   *Response:* Something like an SOS alarm, that can only be switched off with a power button, and is loud and persistent.

**II. Reporting and Information Sharing**

4. **Reporting an Emergency:** If you were witnessing an emergency, what would be the quickest and easiest way for you to report it through the app? (e.g., a single "SOS" button that sends your location, the ability to upload a photo/video, a quick voice message, or a simple text form).  
   *Response:* Button through, and then photo/video upload

5. **During a Disaster:** Would you be willing to provide real-time updates on your immediate surroundings (e.g., "road is blocked," "power is out") to help response teams and other users? What would make you feel safe doing so?  
   *Response:* Minimal No. Of Questions

6. **Trust in Information:** The app will summarize information from official news, social media, and other user reports. What are your biggest concerns about the accuracy of this information, and what would help you trust the updates you receive?  
   *Response:* The source needs to be there with the information, so the user can make an intelligent decision.

**III. Maps and UI**

7. **Interactive Map:** When looking at the live disaster map, what features would be most useful to you and your family? (e.g., locations of emergency shelters, medical aid stations, road closures, safe zones, or family members who also use the app).  
   *Response:* Area of the disaster, and the location of the responders.

8. **Resource Tracking:** How helpful would it be to see the real-time location of dispatched emergency services (like ambulances or fire trucks) on the map during an incident?  
   *Response:* ETA would be helpful, route wouldn’t matter.

**IV. Post-Disaster and Overall Feedback**

9. **Aftermath and Recovery:** Once a disaster has passed, what kind of information would you find most helpful to receive through the app? (e.g., updates on recovery efforts, information on financial aid, or tips for future preparedness).  
   *Response:* What is the status of the affected civilians, guidelines of what should be done next.

10. **Overall Concerns & Wishlist:** Aside from the features discussed, what is your biggest concern about using an application like this for your safety (e.g., data privacy, battery consumption)? Is there any one feature you believe is essential that we haven't mentioned?  
    *Response:* Will the app be running 24-7, or will only activate during the disaster, also, will it use location 24-7?
