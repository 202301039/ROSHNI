| **1. Purpose & Goals**             | • To reduce ad-hoc/disorganised responses to disasters by putting in place a standardised response mechanism. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• To strengthen and standardise disaster response in India: quicker, more efficient, better coordinated, with clear lines of authority. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• To institutionalise roles and structures (Incident Response Teams at various levels) so that when disasters or incidents happen, there is little ambiguity. ([NIDM][1])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **2. Stakeholders & Roles**        | • *National level authorities:* NDMA, ministries, nodal departments. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• *State / District / Sub-Division / Tehsil / Block levels:* Incident Response Teams (IRTs), Responsible Officers (ROs) at state and district (often Chief Secretary / District Magistrate). ([NIDM][1]) <br>• *Incident Commander (IC)* and his/her Command Staff (Liaison Officer, Safety Officer, Information/Media Officer). ([NIDM][1]) <br>• General Staff: Operations Section (OSC), Planning Section (PSC), Logistics Section, etc. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Supporting agencies: local authorities, community groups, NGOs/volunteers, civil defence, PRIs, police, fire services, health etc. ([NIDM][1])                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **3. Processes & Workflows**       | • Pre-disaster phase: planning, training of IRTs; issuing standing orders; integration of IRS into Disaster Management Plans. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Early warning or incident detection triggers activation of IRTs by Responsible Officer (RO). ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Delegation of IC if required; setting up the Incident Command Post (ICP) or relevant facilities. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Sections of General Staff apply: Operations, Planning, Logistics; subordinate units/branches/divisions work under IC. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Resource mobilisation / supply / facility establishment (camps, staging areas, helipads) managed via Logistics Section; planning strategy via Planning Section. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Implementation of Incident Action Plan (IAP), periodic briefings / debriefings. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Demobilisation, post-incident review, learning / updating plans. ([NIDM][1]) |
| **4. Data Requirements**           | • Situational information: what type of incident, location, severity, impact. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Resource inventory: what teams, equipment, supplies are available; where; mobilization status. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Communication / weather / forecasts (IMD etc.), hazard forecasting. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Infrastructure status (roads, utilities, helipads, communications) to understand constraints. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Periodic updates: status of ongoing operations, personnel deployment, progress vs plan. <br>• Geographic / spatial data: jurisdictions, divisions, mapping of incident areas. <br>• Documentation / record-keeping via standard forms: IAP, logs, reporting forms. ([NIDM][1])                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **5. Constraints & Rules**         | • Legal mandate: the Disaster Management Act, 2005 gives NDMA & state agencies responsibilities. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Hierarchical lines: Responsible Officers (ROs), Incident Commanders, etc.; delegated authority must be clear. <br>• Span of control: Sections / Divisions cannot grow beyond manageable limits; ICS-style structure applied. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Resource constraints: availability of trained personnel, transport, communication infrastructure, funding. <br>• Geographic / logistical constraints: remote areas, terrain, damaged infrastructure. <br>• Timeliness: some decisions must be made quickly; plans/training must exist earlier. <br>• Coordination constraints: multiple agencies, overlapping jurisdictions; clarity needed to avoid conflicting instructions.                                                                                           |
| **6. Non-Functional Needs**        | • **Clarity & Simplicity** of structure so people know who does what (IC, RO, section chiefs). <br>• **Reliability / Responsiveness**: ability to activate teams quickly; communications must be dependable. <br>• **Scalability and Flexibility**: IRS can scale from small incidents to large disasters; structures adapt (branches, divisions). ([NIDM][1]) <br>• **Accountability & Transparency**: use of standard forms; roles/responsibilities defined; documentation of decisions (IAP etc.). <br>• **Training & Capacity Building**: responders trained before incidents; periodic drills. ([NIDM][2]) <br>• **Coordination / Interoperability**: among departments, levels of government, with NGOs/volunteers, with external agencies. <br>• **Resource availability / logistic support**: staging areas, helipads etc., equipment available in time.                           |
| **7. Pain Points / Gaps**          | • Role ambiguity in some cases (delegation might not be clear) causing delays or duplication. <br>• In many districts / states, insufficient training or untrained personnel in IRTs; capacity gaps. <br>• Communication breakdowns / lack of unified communications; sometimes lack of online DSS or GIS support. <br>• Resource constraints: funding, logistics, supply chain delays; shortage of infrastructure in remote / hilly areas. <br>• Coordination among agencies / departments / levels of government often difficult under pressure. <br>• Plans may exist but not updated or tested; sometimes documentation / drills are weak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **8. Outputs & Deliverables**      | • Incident Response Team activation plans; Incident Action Plan (IAP) for each incident. <br>• Standard forms & formats: checklists, forms for resource request, documentation, demobilisation plan, reporting. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Facilities: Incident Command Post (ICP), staging areas, helipads / helibases, camps / relief camps as needed. <br>• Training modules / training outputs (skills, trained personnel). <br>• State and district level Disaster Management Plans that integrate IRS. <br>• Briefing / debriefing reports and post-incident reviews. <br>• Communication strategies: media / information officer outputs; situation reports to higher levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **9. Compliance & Accountability** | • Responsible Officers (ROs) at State and District levels are legally responsible for implementation of IRS in their jurisdictions under DM Act. ([NIDM][1]) <br>• Incident Commander is accountable for onsite implementation of IAP. <br>• Standard documentation (forms, logs) to serve for later audit / review. <br>• Training / induction of IRT members ensures accountability of role performance. <br>• Coordinated line of reporting: IC → RO → higher levels (state, national) for oversight. <br>• Post-incident evaluation / lessons learned cycles; updating plans / frameworks. <br>• Integration into district/state DM plans binds accountability in planning phases, not just reactive ones.                                                                                                                                                                             |
