| **1. Purpose & Goals**          | The platform was created to solve the visibility gap in disaster-preparedness training across the Asia-Pacific. Its main aim is to act as a central hub for information on training events — showing who is training, where, and what disaster scenarios or skills are covered. This helps reduce duplication, supports smarter funding decisions, and fosters collaboration between governments, NGOs, and local actors. Ultimately, it’s about strengthening first responders so communities can react faster and more effectively in crises. |
| **2. Stakeholders & Roles**     | Key users include **first responders** (firefighters, medics, humanitarian NGOs) who rely on and contribute training data, and **donors or funding agencies** who use it to identify gaps and underfunded regions. **Ushahidi** manages the technical platform, while **event organizers** submit accurate training details. The wider humanitarian community — including **analysts and researchers** — can tap into the data to plan, coordinate, and track preparedness trends.                                                             |
| **3. Processes & Workflows**    | The workflow starts with **event submissions** via an online form. These are then displayed on an interactive **map**, powered by the Crowdmap API. Users can filter by time period, event type, or disaster category to find relevant opportunities. Donors and NGOs use this view to run **gap analyses**, spotting areas with too few trainings. Behind the scenes, the platform went through multiple **testing cycles** to ensure it works smoothly and remains user-friendly, even for people with limited technical skills.                      |
| **4. Data Requirements**        | The platform depends on structured data inputs: event details (title, description, type), dates (start and end), geospatial data (coordinates for mapping), and tags (disaster type, training type). Accuracy and timeliness are essential — bad data could mislead decisions. Consistent labeling of categories is also critical, since the filters and map rely on standardized event attributes.                                                                                                                                                |
| **5. Constraints & Rules**      | Since it relies on **user-submitted data**, accuracy and completeness are constant challenges. Moderation or validation is implied but not deeply described. The scope is also focused on **Asia-Pacific**, limiting global use. Technically, the design favors **simplicity and accessibility** over advanced features, meaning filters are deliberately restricted (time, type, disaster) to keep the interface approachable.                                                                                                                               |
| **6. Tools & Technologies**     | The platform is powered by the **Ushahidi Crowdmap API**, which enables geospatial visualization. A **web-based interface** lets users submit and browse events, with lightweight, cloud-based architecture for scalability. Usability and resilience testing ensured the platform could handle real-world conditions, especially during crises when reliability is critical.                                                                                                                                            |
| **7. Outputs & Deliverables**   | The main deliverable is a **public interactive map** showing training activities across the region, alongside **filterable lists** for detailed exploration. Donors and NGOs gain **insights into coverage patterns**, making it easier to spot underserved areas. Beyond this, the platform itself acts as a **knowledge-sharing hub**, encouraging transparency and coordination in disaster-preparedness efforts.                                                                                                                               |
| **8. Outcomes & Impact**        | The platform improves **decision-making for donors**, who can now target funding more effectively. Organizations avoid redundant efforts by seeing what’s already planned nearby. This leads to smarter use of scarce resources and a stronger, more evenly distributed training landscape. Most importantly, it boosts **community resilience**, ensuring faster, more coordinated disaster responses when emergencies hit.                                                                                                                     |
| **9. Challenges & Limitations** | Ongoing challenges include the **quality and completeness of submitted data**, since the system only works if contributors stay engaged. The **basic filtering options** limit deeper analysis that richer metadata might enable. Its **regional focus** excludes other disaster-prone areas that could benefit. And because the model depends heavily on **continuous participation**, any drop-off in contributions risks making the data outdated.                                                                                                             |
