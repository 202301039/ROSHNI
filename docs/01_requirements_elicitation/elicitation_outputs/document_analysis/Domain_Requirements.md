# Unified Domain Requirements — Disaster Response & Data Sharing

The system must enable lawful, proportionate, and efficient data sharing and operational coordination in emergencies while ensuring the protection of individual rights, privacy, and public trust. It should support life-saving activities, prevent harm, and provide clarity for decision-makers under pressure. The framework must balance urgency with compliance, ensuring accountability, transparency, and effectiveness across international contexts.

The purpose and goals include protecting fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals regarding personal and health data, allowing disclosures during emergencies without undue barriers, and enabling lawful data exchange that supports disaster response, public health, and safety. The system must reduce ambiguity, strengthen coordination, and support faster, more efficient, and standardised actions. It must ensure that privacy and compliance are not seen as barriers in urgent scenarios.

Stakeholders include data controllers, processors, supervisory authorities, covered entities such as providers and insurers, business associates, subcontractors, incident commanders, responsible officers, planning and logistics staff, public health authorities, emergency relief organisations, governance and legal teams, and individuals whose data is being processed or shared. Data protection officers and legal advisors play critical roles in guiding lawful disclosures. Supporting agencies like NGOs, civil defence, fire services, and law enforcement must also be integrated.

Processes and workflows include pre-disaster planning, training, and integration of protocols in continuity and disaster management plans. During emergencies, triggers may include imminent threats, incapacity of individuals, or declaration of an incident. The system must support lawful basis identification (vital interests, legal obligation, public interest, treatment, imminent danger), ensure proportionality and necessity tests, apply the minimum necessary rule, and allow professional judgment where consent cannot be obtained. Secure data transfer and communication channels must be used. Decision-making must be documented, including justification, basis for sharing, recipients, and purpose. Post-event reviews, demobilisation, and updates to plans are mandatory.

Data requirements include handling personal data, special categories such as health and biometrics, and protected health information. Only relevant and accurate data should be shared, with sensitive data requiring additional safeguards. Metadata must capture who shared what, with whom, when, why, and under which legal basis. Standardised forms and logs (incident action plans, reports, disclosure records) are required. Information on incident type, severity, situational forecasts, resource availability, and infrastructure must be collected and shared securely.

Constraints and rules derive from GDPR principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and accountability; HIPAA requirements including the privacy rule, minimum necessary standard, and limited emergency waivers; ICO guidance emphasising proportionality, necessity, and accountability in urgent sharing; and the NDMA’s statutory framework under the Disaster Management Act, mandating the Incident Response System structure, clear delegation, and span-of-control. Rights of individuals persist across frameworks, though may be limited under vital interest or emergency grounds. State-specific or stricter laws must also be respected.

Non-functional needs include speed of decision-making, reliability of communication systems, security safeguards, scalability to mass emergencies, flexibility for different incident sizes, transparency, accountability, and interoperability between agencies. The system must remain resilient under disrupted conditions, support audit readiness, and provide templates, checklists, and decision-support tools to enable consistency.

Pain points include fear of legal consequences delaying data sharing, role ambiguity and lack of training, cross-border or inter-agency complexity, inconsistent application of proportionality, over- or under-sharing of data, security vulnerabilities under pressure, shortages of resources and logistics, communication breakdowns, and outdated or untested plans. These issues can lead to delays in response and reduced effectiveness of emergency operations.

Outputs and deliverables must include records of processing and disclosures, data-sharing agreements and templates, emergency DPIAs, waiver declarations, incident action plans, training modules, checklists, request forms, protocols, logs, media and situation reports, public transparency documentation, and integrated disaster management plans. Emergency facilities such as command posts, relief camps, and communication centres must be documented and supported.

Compliance and accountability require that controllers, processors, covered entities, business associates, responsible officers, and incident commanders remain accountable under their respective laws and frameworks. Documentation, audit logs, and post-incident reviews are mandatory. Oversight by supervisory authorities, regulators, and governance structures ensures enforcement. Sanctions and fines apply for violations, though emergency grounds may provide lawful exceptions. Reporting chains must be followed, and transparency maintained with individuals and the public as feasible.

In summary, the unified requirements demand a system that integrates international data protection and health privacy regulations with operational disaster management structures. It must protect rights while enabling effective, lawful, and coordinated responses. By aligning compliance, operational clarity, and non-functional reliability, the platform can bridge global best practices and local statutory needs in emergency data sharing and disaster response.
