| **1. Purpose & Goals**      | • Ensure PHI can be shared in emergencies for treatment, public health, and safety without undue privacy barriers. <br> • Remind covered entities and business associates of HIPAA rules during emergencies. <br> • Clarify permitted disclosures, emergency planning, and flexibility. <br> • Balance privacy with protecting life, controlling disease, and addressing imminent threats.                                                                                                                     |
| **2. Stakeholders & Roles** | • **Covered Entities**: healthcare providers, health plans, clearinghouses (hold PHI, responsible for compliance). <br> • **Business Associates** (and subcontractors) that process PHI on behalf of covered entities. <br> • **Public Health Authorities** (local/state/federal agencies authorised to act on health data). <br> • **Individuals/patients**, families, friends, caregivers (consent, notification, involvement in care). <br> • **Emergency/disaster relief orgs** (e.g. Red Cross). <br> • **Regulators/enforcers**: HHS OCR, state health departments, state law. |
| **3. Processes & Workflows**| • **Planning**: emergency/disaster protocols; BA agreements must contemplate emergency disclosures. <br> • **Triggering conditions**: declared emergencies, imminent health/safety threats, public health emergencies, incapacity of patients. <br> • **Decision-making**: minimum necessary PHI, lawful basis, professional judgment, or inferred consent. <br> • **Disclosure actions**: PHI shared without authorisation when permitted (treatment, public health, care/notification, imminent danger, facility directory). <br> • **Safeguards**: maintain admin/technical/physical protections. <br> • **Waivers**: some HIPAA provisions waived temporarily under federal declaration (limited scope). <br> • **Post-event**: restore compliance, review disclosures, update agreements. |
| **4. Data Requirements**    | • **PHI**: individually identifiable health information. <br> • **Minimum necessary rule**: apply except for treatment. <br> • **Categories**: location, general condition, diagnosis — keep detail minimal. <br> • **Facility directories**: limited to presence, general condition, location. <br> • **Metadata/provenance**: record consent status, directory status, legal basis. <br> • **Format/channels**: secure, governed by BA agreements, respect patient preferences, verbal permissions if possible, professional judgment if incapacitated. |
| **5. Constraints & Rules**  | • HIPAA Privacy Rule remains in effect during emergencies. <br> • Waivers are **narrow**: only certain provisions may be suspended (e.g. sanctions/penalties), and only in defined areas/timeframes. <br> • Minimum necessary still applies (except for treatment). <br> • State laws may impose stricter requirements. <br> • Patient rights persist (restrictions, confidential communications, notices) unless explicitly waived. <br> • Professional judgment needed when patient incapacitated. <br> • Directory information requires respecting objections unless waiver applies. <br> • BA agreements must allow emergency disclosures (or be amended). |
| **6. Non-Functional Needs** | • **Timeliness**: rapid disclosure for treatment, notification, public health. <br> • **Reliability**: correct and accurate PHI to avoid harm. <br> • **Security**: maintain protective measures. <br> • **Auditability**: keep records for review. <br> • **Flexibility**: handle varying emergencies. <br> • **Scalability**: mass casualty/public health events. <br> • **Resilience**: ability to share PHI under system disruption. <br> • **Decision support**: protocols/tools guiding permissible disclosures (HHS provides planning tool). |
| **7. Pain Points / Gaps**   | • Confusion about permissible disclosures leads to hesitation/delay. <br> • Variations in state law complicate compliance. <br> • Ambiguity when patients cannot consent. <br> • Temporary/informal BA agreements may not cover emergencies. <br> • Risk of over-disclosure or inconsistent application of “minimum necessary.” <br> • Security/privacy risks in chaotic situations. <br> • Accountability gaps: poor records of disclosures. <br> • Limited understanding of waiver procedures and applicability. |
| **8. Outputs & Deliverables**| • Emergency/disaster protocols addressing HIPAA disclosures. <br> • Decision tools/flowcharts (HHS provides). <br> • Business Associate Agreements with emergency disclosure clauses. <br> • Documentation of disclosures (what PHI, to whom, basis). <br> • Waiver declarations/records (timeframe, area, facility). <br> • Privacy notices, facility directory info, verbal permissions when possible. <br> • Post-incident reviews, policy/SOP updates. <br> • Training/guidance for workforce. |
| **9. Compliance & Accountability** | • Covered entities must comply with HIPAA Privacy Rule except for waived provisions. <br> • Business associates accountable under BA agreements. <br> • Enforcement by HHS/OCR — penalties may be waived in declared emergencies, but noncompliance (esp. willful neglect) still sanctioned. <br> • Must maintain audit logs of disclosures. <br> • Patient rights respected as much as feasible. <br> • Legal liability if HIPAA violated outside waiver scope. <br> • Oversight and post-emergency review required. |
