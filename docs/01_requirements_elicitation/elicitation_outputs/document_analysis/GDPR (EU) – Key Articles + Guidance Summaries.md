| **Pointer**                | **Extracted Content / Key Points from GDPR / Related Guidance**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **1. Purpose & Goals**      | • Protect natural persons in relation to personal data processing, ensure free movement of data within EU/EEA (Art. 1). <br> • Ensure processing is lawful, fair, transparent, and respects rights of data subjects. <br> • Define high standards of security, data minimisation, purpose limitation, and extra protections for special categories of data. |
| **2. Stakeholders & Roles** | • **Data Subject**: individuals whose data is processed — rights include access, rectification, erasure, objection, portability, etc. <br> • **Controller**: decides purpose/means of processing; ensures lawful basis, transparency, and compliance. <br> • **Processor**: processes data for the controller; must follow instructions and ensure safeguards. <br> • **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: required in some cases; advises and monitors compliance. <br> • **Supervisory Authorities**: national regulators; EDPB coordinates consistency across EU. |
| **3. Processes & Workflows**| • **Lawful Basis Determination (Art. 6)**: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, legitimate interests. <br> • **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: required for high-risk processing (e.g. special categories, large-scale, automated). <br> • **Privacy by Design/Default**: minimal processing, pseudonymisation, restricted access. <br> • **Transparency & Notice**: privacy notices when collecting or receiving third-party data. <br> • **Rights Fulfilment**: processes for access, erasure, rectification, restriction, portability, objection, automated decision making. |
| **4. Data Requirements**    | • **Personal Data**: any information relating to an identifiable person (direct/indirect identifiers). <br> • **Special Categories (Art. 9)**: health, race, religion, biometrics, etc. — higher thresholds for processing. <br> • **Data Minimisation**: process only what is necessary for the purpose. <br> • **Accuracy**: keep data correct and up-to-date. <br> • **Security Measures**: encryption, pseudonymisation, access control, breach notification, technical/organisational safeguards. |
| **5. Constraints & Rules**  | • Must establish a lawful basis (Art. 6) and comply with extra rules for special category data (Art. 9). <br> • **Purpose Limitation**: data only for specified purposes, not incompatible further use. <br> • **Storage Limitation**: keep data no longer than necessary. <br> • **Accountability**: controllers must prove compliance via records. <br> • **International Transfers (Chapter V)**: only permitted under adequacy decisions, SCCs, binding rules, or safeguards. <br> • **Rights of Data Subjects**: must be respected except in limited exceptions. <br> • **Supervisory Authority Oversight** with penalties for non-compliance. |
| **6. Non-Functional Needs** | • **Accountability/Traceability**: records of processing, logs, DPIAs. <br> • **Security & Integrity**: encryption, technical/organisational measures, secure endpoints. <br> • **Reliability & Availability**: resilience, ensure access/erasure rights are technically feasible. <br> • **Scalability**: large-scale processing must maintain compliance. <br> • **Privacy by Design/Default**: embedded throughout lifecycle. <br> • **Transparency & Oversight**: human checks in automated profiling/decisions. <br> • **Breach Response**: rapid detection, supervisory notification. <br> • **Data Quality**: ensure accuracy, rectification mechanisms. |
| **7. Pain Points / Gaps**   | • Ambiguity in choosing lawful basis, esp. in emergencies. <br> • Balancing urgent action with compliance (e.g. consent impractical). <br> • Complexities in international transfers; Schrems II invalidated adequacy mechanisms. <br> • Elevated risk in processing special categories; organisations often unprepared. <br> • Ensuring transparency and rights in emergencies is challenging. <br> • DPIA burdensome, sometimes overlooked or too late. <br> • Data minimisation conflicts with data-hungry AI/analytics. <br> • High risk of breaches, with reputational/legal consequences. <br> • Different interpretations across EU states create inconsistency. |
| **8. Outputs & Deliverables**| • **Privacy Notices / Policies**: state lawful basis, purpose, rights. <br> • **Records of Processing Activities (Art. 30)**: logs of data uses, purposes, recipients. <br> • **DPIAs**: for high-risk processing, with risk mitigations. <br> • **Controller–Processor Contracts**: defining roles, security, breach obligations. <br> • **Retention & Rights Policies**: SOPs for data lifecycle. <br> • **Breach Notification Mechanisms**: to DPAs and individuals. <br> • **Certifications / Codes of Conduct**: support compliance, esp. for transfers. <br> • **Templates/Tools**: checklists for lawful basis, SCCs. |
| **9. Compliance & Accountability** | • Controllers/processors must demonstrate compliance: logs, DPIAs, records. <br> • **Supervisory Authorities** may issue warnings, fines (up to 4% global turnover or €20M). <br> • **Data Subject Rights**: access, objection, erasure, portability, restriction, etc. <br> • **International Transfer Risk**: invalid safeguards can result in enforcement. <br> • **Processor–Controller Contracts**: must define security, instructions, breach terms. <br> • **Auditable Evidence**: decisions, especially in automated decision making. <br> • **Corrective Measures**: suspension, deletion, fines. <br> • **Obligation to respond**: to access/complaints within deadlines. |
