| **1. Purpose & Goals**      | • Enable organisations to share personal data in emergencies when necessary and proportionate to protect life, prevent serious physical harm, safeguarding, public health, national security. <br> • Remove uncertainty around legal barriers; plan ahead so sharing can be done quickly but lawfully.                                                                                           |
| **2. Stakeholders & Roles** | • Data controllers in organisations (public sector bodies, emergency services, health care, etc.) who decide what to share. <br> • Data Protection Officers (DPOs) or equivalent may advise or document decisions. <br> • Recipients of data (other agencies: government departments, health, police, fire). <br> • Individuals whose data is shared. <br> • Senior leadership / legal / governance. |
| **3. Processes & Workflows**| • Pre-emergency planning: identify likely data needs, do DPIAs, include in continuity/disaster recovery plans. <br> • Triggering: when actual emergency arises (risk of harm, loss of life, public health threat). <br> • Assess necessity & proportionality: share minimum data. <br> • Document decisions (justification, lawful basis, data shared). <br> • Implement securely. <br> • Post-event review. |
| **4. Data Requirements**    | • Share only relevant personal data. <br> • Special category data (health, etc.) needs extra care and lawful basis. <br> • Metadata: timestamp, purpose, who shared, recipients, justification. <br> • Data must be accurate/up-to-date. <br> • No rigid technical format but written records/templates are expected.                                                                                   |
| **5. Constraints & Rules**  | • Legal basis under UK GDPR/DPA 2018 (vital interests, public health, legal obligation). <br> • Necessity & proportionality required. <br> • Principles apply: fairness, transparency, security, accountability. <br> • Rights of individuals still apply, though limited in emergencies. <br> • Must implement safeguards. <br> • Special rules for special category data. <br> • Risks if undocumented.   |
| **6. Non-Functional Needs** | • Fast/low latency decisions. <br> • Availability of pre-agreed templates/procedures. <br> • Secure sharing and controlled access. <br> • Transparency and auditability (recorded decisions). <br> • Resilience under adverse conditions. <br> • Scalability for large-scale emergencies.                                                                                                            |
| **7. Pain Points / Gaps**   | • Uncertainty/legal risk delays sharing. <br> • Lack of pre-planning means ad hoc sharing. <br> • Risks of over-sharing or under-sharing. <br> • Data may be incomplete or outdated. <br> • Security risks under pressure. <br> • Balancing speed vs compliance. <br> • Public trust issues from misuse. <br> • Unclear roles/responsibilities slow decisions.                                      |
| **8. Outputs & Deliverables**| • Data sharing decision/request forms (templates). <br> • Pre-arranged data sharing agreements. <br> • Records of shared data, with whom, and when. <br> • Post-incident reviews/reports. <br> • Public transparency docs if required. <br> • Guidance checklists / emergency plan appendices.                                                                                                      |
| **9. Compliance & Accountability** | • Must demonstrate lawfulness, necessity, proportionality. <br> • DPIAs required when high risk. <br> • Use data sharing agreements to clarify roles. <br> • Documentation of decisions. <br> • Controllers responsible for compliance always. <br> • ICO enforcement possible for failures. <br> • Data subject rights remain (to extent possible).                                        |
